PEP8 - Python Enhancement Proposal

The Zen of Python

The idea of PEP8 is help us to write Ptyhon codes in a 'pythonic' way

1 - Use Camel Case when naming Classes
2 - Use lowercase name to describe functions ou variables, and if you need an space, replace this by an underline
3 - Use 4 space to indation!! DO NOT USE TAB
4 - Blank lines
    - Separate functions and definitions with 2 blank lines
    - Methods into classes must be separated with a single blank line
5 - Imports ALWAYS need to be made in separated lines and must be in the top of the file
6 - Do not use spaces in expressions and instructions
7 - ALWAYS finish an instruction with a line
